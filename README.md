# **LucidOS – Overview**

## **Introduction**
**LucidOS** is a Linux-based operating system built to provide a simple, polished, and user-friendly experience while maintaining the flexibility of open-source software.  
The goal of LucidOS is to make Linux accessible to both casual and advanced users, offering a clean, lightweight system that performs efficiently while including modern UI design and compatibility with Windows® and macOS applications.

LucidOS 1.0 is codenamed **Aurora**.

---

## **Core Goals**
- Deliver a **modern, user-friendly Linux distribution** that can serve as a daily driver for all experience levels.  
- Maintain a **lightweight and stable** foundation built on Ubuntu.  
- Provide **out-of-the-box support** for Windows® applications via Wine, Proton, and Proton-GE.  
- Introduce a **refined UI/UX** inspired by macOS aesthetics with skeuomorphic, glossy icons and smooth animations.  
- Offer **exclusive LucidOS tools** and configurations designed to enhance usability and simplify setup.  
- Separate **open-source components** from **proprietary visual and brand assets** under distinct licenses.

---

## **Promotion**
LucidOS will be promoted through various online platforms and videos during its development cycle:
- A cinematic video featuring a 3D laptop model running LucidOS 1.0 *Aurora* (inspired by the *Introducing Windows 95 Mobile* video).  
- A follow-up *evolution-style* video showcasing Linux history leading up to LucidOS (similar to *Mac OS Evolution*).  
- Marketing and discussion channels may include **YouTube**, **TikTok**, **Linux forums**, and a **LucidOS Discord server** for community engagement.

---

## **Setup Experience**
When first booting LucidOS, users will see an introductory animation or boot video (similar to macOS Snow Leopard’s welcome sequence).  
After that, the **initial setup wizard** will guide users through system configuration and feature selection.

### **Planned Setup Modes**
- **Casual Mode:** Simplified experience for new or non-technical users.  
- **Advanced Mode:** Enables additional configuration and system-level control.  
- **Intermediate Mode (planned):** Balanced mode between casual and advanced.

LucidOS will **not** include a traditional *live USB* mode. Installation will be required before use to ensure consistency and performance.

---

## **User Interface / UX**
LucidOS features a **custom-designed desktop environment** with a strong focus on design coherence and fluidity.

### **Key UI/UX Features**
- Custom **skeuomorphic glossy icons** inspired by macOS Sequoia and Tahoe.  
- Built-in options to switch between **macOS-style** and **Windows-style** layouts (similar to ZorinOS).  
- Default LucidOS branding (wallpapers, icons, animations) that remains consistent across all systems.  
- Emphasis on **smooth transitions**, **responsive animations**, and **visual depth**.

---

## **Licensing Model**
LucidOS follows a **dual-licensing structure**:

| Component | License | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Core System Code | **GPLv3** | Based on Ubuntu and fully open-source. |
| Visual Assets (icons, wallpapers, branding, animations) | **Proprietary** | Cannot be redistributed, modified, or reused. |
| Exclusive LucidOS Applications | **Proprietary** | Copyrighted software developed by the LucidOS team. |

This structure ensures the system’s transparency at the code level while preserving the distinct identity and design of LucidOS.

---

## **Software and Applications**
The first release, **LucidOS 1.0 Aurora**, will include:
- Essential Ubuntu-based system tools  
- **Chromium or Google Chrome** (default browser)  
- **VLC Media Player**  
- Other lightweight utilities to maintain performance and usability  

Future updates will:
- Replace generic Ubuntu apps with **custom LucidOS applications**  
- Introduce proprietary tools designed specifically for LucidOS  
- Maintain compatibility with Ubuntu repositories for package updates  

LucidOS will also be available in two editions:
1. **LucidOS Standard:** General-purpose distribution for most hardware.  
2. **LucidOS Device Edition:** Optimized version for specific LucidOS-certified hardware, similar to macOS hardware integration.

---

## **Windows and macOS App Compatibility**
LucidOS includes compatibility layers for running software from other platforms.

### **Windows Application Support**
LucidOS integrates with:
- **Wine**
- **Proton**
- **Proton-GE**
- **WineStore** (for managing compatibility versions)

An exclusive LucidOS tool, tentatively named **AppConfig**, will automate Windows app setup:
- Users can search for applications within AppConfig.  
- The tool applies predefined compatibility configurations for each app version.  
- Complex manual setup is reduced to a simple guided process.

### **macOS Application Support**
LucidOS also plans to include **Darling**, allowing limited execution of select macOS applications.

---

## **System Updates**
All major and incremental updates will:
- Be carefully optimized for performance, reliability, and security.  
- Maintain stability across versions.  
- Protect proprietary LucidOS software and branding under copyright and license terms.

## **Project Summary**

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Base** | Ubuntu (GPLv3) |
| **Codename** | Aurora (v1.0) |
| **Goal** | Easiest and most visually refined Linux distro |
| **UI Theme** | Glossy skeuomorphic style inspired by macOS |
| **Software Compatibility** | Windows® (via Wine/Proton), macOS (via Darling) |
