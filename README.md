# lucidOS – Release Goals and Future Plans

lucidOS is a sleek, Ubuntu-based Linux distribution designed to be the most user-friendly operating system for both casual and advanced users. Inspired by macOS and CuteFishOS, it combines macOS’s smooth experience with the ability to run both Linux and Windows software easily. lucidOS offers :

# Dual modes:

Basic mode for casual users who want an intuitive, ready-to-go OS.

Advanced mode for power users, with terminal access and more complex system controls.

# Running Windows Applications (lucidOS will include Proton/Wine)

## **AppConfig or LucidOS App**
**AppConfig/LucidOS App** will be an application designed specifically to improve compatibility with Windows® software and much more.

### Purpose

AppConfig enables users to **download and apply compatibility configurations** for Windows programs that do not run correctly on LucidOS using Wine or Proton.  
Each configuration is contributed by the community and tailored for specific applications or versions.

### How It Works

1. A user identifies a Windows® app that does not run properly or at all on LucidOS.  
2. Another user (or developer) creates a configuration that fixes or optimizes compatibility for that Wapp.  
3. The configuration is uploaded and made available through AppConfig.  
4. Other users can **download that configuration** directly from AppConfig.  
5. Once downloaded, the system automatically applies it — **no manual setup is required.**  

After installation, users can open the Windows® application, and it **should** run correctly with the applied settings.

### Core Features of AppConfig/LucidOS App (App name still being decided)

- Browse and download pre-made compatibility configurations.  
- Automatically integrate downloaded configurations with Wine/Proton layers.  
- View configuration metadata (author, app version, compatibility notes).  
- Automatically manage required dependencies or environment variables for each configuration.  
- No technical setup or manual tweaking required after download.
- **Possibly could be rebranded to LucidOS App for more features that LucidOS will have.**







# User Experience:

Clean, smooth animations and a modern interface.

Lightweight, fast, and free of unnecessary bloatware, it's your choice for what you want from LucidOS.

A guided setup process with customizable features on first boot that can be changed anytime.

Ability to run Windows apps and select terminal-based macOS apps, hopefully seamlessly.



# Interface & Branding:

Unique, glossy skeuomorphic icons inspired by macOS Sequoia, Tahoe, and the Ubuntu-based CuteFishOS.

Emphasis on smooth transitions, responsive animations, and visual depth.

Flexible layout options will allow users to emulate a macOS, Windows, or other interface of your choice.


# Gaming
As stated, lucidOS will be able to run Windows Apps via Proton, including video games. You will be able to play most Steam games and Windows apps on lucidOS. More support will be added as lucidOS improves.
(Proton is a compatibility layer developed by Valve)



# Future Plans
#### - Replace generic Ubuntu apps with **custom LucidOS applications**  
#### - Introduce proprietary tools designed specifically for LucidOS  
#### - Maintain compatibility with Ubuntu repositories for package updates
#### - Making Windows applications and possibly select Mac applications  run flawlessly.
#### - Making Linux mainstream in general.
