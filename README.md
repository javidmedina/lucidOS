# lucidOS – Release Goals and Future Plans

LucidOS is a sleek, Ubuntu-based Linux distribution designed to be the most user-friendly operating system for both casual and advanced users. Inspired by macOS, CuteFishOS, and Frutiger Aero, it combines macOS’s smooth experience with the convenience of running Linux, macOS, and Windows software all on one operating system. 

# Roadmap

### Beta Release of LucidOS | (2026)
Based on CuteFishOS so far, which was updated and is now based on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS, as time passes, certain aspects may be changed. Beta is not public yet and may not be for a while.

### Release of LucidOS Aurora| (2026 - 2027) 
LucidOS is planned to target either Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS or Ubuntu 26.04 LTS as its base. The distribution will probably include the CuteFish desktop environment or, contingent on increased developer participation, a custom LucidOS desktop environment.

### LucidOS 2.0 Nebula (Name not guaranteed) (2028 - 2029)
This version of LucidOS will be guaranteed to be based on Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, potentially being upgraded to being based on Ubuntu 28.04 LTS. It will be much more mature in stability and polish, and will probably have its own desktop environment with improved features similar to LucidOS 1.0 Aurora, and so much more to be included.


### Custom desktops and laptops to come with LucidOS | (TBD)


# Planned features : 


## Dual modes:

Basic mode for casual users who want an intuitive, ready-to-go OS.

Advanced mode for power users, with terminal access and more complex system controls.

## Running Windows Applications (lucidOS will include Proton-GE/Wine)

### **LucidOS App/LucidOS Store** (Description needs to be revised/updated)
Description coming soon








# User Experience:

Clean, smooth animations and a modern interface.

Lightweight, fast, and free of unnecessary bloatware, it's your choice for what you want from LucidOS.

A guided setup process with customizable features on first boot that can be changed anytime.

Ability to run Windows apps and select terminal-based macOS apps, hopefully seamlessly.



# Interface & Branding:

Unique, glossy skeuomorphic icons inspired by macOS Sequoia, Tahoe, and the Ubuntu-based CuteFishOS, with a pinch of Frutiger Aero.

Emphasis on smooth transitions, responsive animations, and visual depth.

Flexible layout options will allow users to emulate macOS, Windows, or any other interface of their choice.


# Gaming (Still being worked on)
As stated, lucidOS will be able to run Windows Apps via Proton-GE, including video games. You will be able to play most Steam games and run most Windows applications on lucidOS with Proton-GE being the compatibility layer. More support will be added as lucidOS improves.
(Proton is a compatibility layer developed by Valve, while Proton-GE is a custom configuration of Proton)



# Future Plans (Still being refined at this moment, outdated)
#### - Introduce proprietary tools designed specifically for LucidOS  
#### - Maintain compatibility with Ubuntu repositories for package updates
#### - Making Windows applications and possibly select Mac applications run flawlessly. (May not be possible)
#### - Making Linux mainstream in general. (Impossible)
