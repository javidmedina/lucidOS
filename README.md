# lucidOS – Release Overview and Future Plans

lucidOS is a sleek, Ubuntu-based Linux distribution designed to be the most user-friendly operating system for both casual and advanced users. Inspired by macOS and CuteFishOS, it combines macOS’s smooth experience with the ability to run both Linux and Windows software easily. lucidOS offers :

# Dual modes:

Basic mode for casual users who want an intuitive, ready-to-go OS.

Advanced mode for power users, with terminal access and more complex system controls.

# Running Windows Applications (lucidOS will include Proton/Wine)

## **AppConfig**
**AppConfig** is a proprietary LucidOS application designed specifically to improve compatibility with Windows® software through user-created configuration profiles.

### Purpose

AppConfig enables users to **download and apply compatibility configurations** for Windows programs that do not run correctly on LucidOS using Wine or Proton.  
Each configuration is contributed by the community and tailored for specific applications or versions.

### How It Works

1. A user identifies a Windows® app that does not run properly or at all on LucidOS.  
2. Another user (or developer) creates a configuration that fixes or optimizes compatibility for that Wapp.  
3. The configuration is uploaded and made available through AppConfig.  
4. Other users can **download that configuration** directly from AppConfig.  
5. Once downloaded, the system automatically applies it — **no manual setup is required.**  

After installation, users can open the Windows® application, and it **should** run correctly with the applied settings.

### Core Features of AppConfig

- Browse and download pre-made compatibility configurations.  
- Automatically integrate downloaded configurations with Wine/Proton layers.  
- View configuration metadata (author, app version, compatibility notes).  
- Automatically manage required dependencies or environment variables for each configuration.  
- No technical setup or manual tweaking required after download.







# User Experience:

Clean, smooth animations and a modern interface.

Lightweight, fast, and free of unnecessary bloatware.

A guided setup process with customizable features on first boot.

Ability to run Windows apps and select terminal-based macOS apps.



# Interface & Branding:

Unique, glossy skeuomorphic icons inspired by macOS Sequoia and Tahoe.

Default wallpapers, branding, and UI elements are proprietary, maintaining the lucidOS identity.

Emphasis on smooth transitions, responsive animations, and visual depth.

Flexible layout options allow users to emulate macOS, Windows, or other styles. 


# Gaming
As stated, lucidOS will have the ability to run Windows Apps via Proton, and that includes video games. You will be able to play a good majority of Steam games and Windows apps in general on lucidOS. More support will always be added as lucidOS improves more and more.
(Proton is a compatibility layer developed by Valve)



# Future Plans
- Replace generic Ubuntu apps with **custom LucidOS applications**  
- Introduce proprietary tools designed specifically for LucidOS  
- Maintain compatibility with Ubuntu repositories for package updates
- Make Windows Apps run flawlessly
